#Power BI Dashboard Projects

This repository contains Power BI projects focused on data analysis, insights generation, and interactive dashboard development.
The dashboards were built by analyzing raw datasets, transforming and modeling data, and presenting insights through clear and interactive visualizations. The goal of each project is to support data-driven decision-making by highlighting trends, patterns, and key performance indicators.
